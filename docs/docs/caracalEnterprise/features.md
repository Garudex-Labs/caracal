# Features

Caracal Enterprise Edition offers a suite of advanced features designed to meet the rigorous demands of modern enterprises.

## Enterprise Sync

Enterprise Sync bridges the gap between local development and centralized management. It ensures that your distributed agent infrastructure remains consistent and compliant.

-   **Centralized Policy Management**: Define policies once in the Enterprise dashboard and enforce them across all connected agents.
-   **Real-time Synchronization**: Updates to policies are propagated to connected agents in real-time.
-   **Offline Mode**: Agents can continue to operate with the last known policy configuration even if the connection to the Enterprise server is lost.

## Fail-Closed Security Model

Security is paramount in Caracal Enterprise. We adhere to a "Fail-Closed" security model.

-   **Default Deny**: All actions are blocked by default. Explicit permissions must be granted via policies.
-   **Secure Defaults**: The system comes pre-configured with secure settings to minimize the attack surface.
-   **Tamper-Proof Logging**: All security-critical events are logged to a tamper-proof audit trail.

## Onboarding and Agent Management

Managing a large fleet of agents is made easy with our intuitive onboarding and management tools.

-   **Bulk Onboarding**: Register multiple agents simultaneously using CSV import or API integration.
-   **Agent Health Monitoring**: Monitor the health and status of your agents in real-time.
-   **Remote Configuration**: Update agent configurations remotely without needing to access the physical device.

## Advanced Analytics

Gain deep insights into your agent interactions and system performance.

-   **Custom Dashboards**: Create custom dashboards to visualize the metrics that matter most to your business.
-   **Usage Reports**: Generate detailed reports on agent usage and resource consumption.
-   **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically detect and alert on unusual agent behavior.
