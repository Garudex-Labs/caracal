# Getting Started with Caracal Enterprise

Welcome to Caracal Enterprise, the complete platform for managing, securing, and auditing your agentic workflows.

## Overview

Caracal Enterprise provides a centralized control plane for your AI agents. It allows you to:

-   **Define Authority**: Create policies that dictate what your agents can and cannot do.
-   **Enforce Rules**: Use the Caracal Gateway or SDK to enforce these policies in real-time.
-   **Audit Activity**: Track every action, validation, and denial in an immutable ledger.

## The Dashboard

The Enterprise Dashboard is your command center. From here, you can:

-   **Onboard Agents**: Register new AI agents and issue them credentials.
-   **Manage Policies**: Create and update authority policies.
-   **Monitor Activity**: View real-time analytics and audit logs.
-   **Configure Gateways**: Manage your deployment of Caracal Gateways.

## Next Steps
